Modeling Phase – Predictive Analytics Approach for NY Bank Loan Approval Optimization
The goal of the modeling phase in the CRISP-DM cycle is to transition from hindsight understanding historical approval delays to foresight that helps NY Bank predict which loan applications are likely to encounter bottlenecks. Based on the structure of the Kaggle MIT loan dataset and the business need to classify applications by risk of delay, this project will employ two predictive modeling approaches: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification. Using both models enables comparison between interpretability and predictive power, ensuring that NY Bank’s senior leadership receives a decision environment that is both transparent and actionable.
Model Selection and Rationale
Logistic Regression is selected as the baseline model because it is interpretable, easy to deploy, and widely used in financial decision systems. It predicts the probability that an application will experience delays based on customer demographics, credit metrics, and documentation patterns. Its coefficients help NY Bank identify which factors such as missing documents, low credit scores, or high debt-to-income ratios are most strongly associated with slow approvals. This aligns with the bank’s need for clear justification in regulated environments.
Random Forest Classification, on the other hand, provides higher predictive accuracy and handles nonlinear relationships that the logistic model cannot capture. It also excels at identifying complex interactions between variables such as employment length, income stability, loan purpose, and documentation completeness. Random Forests are resilient to noisy data and outliers, making them suitable for the bank’s operational data, which may include human entry errors, inconsistent credit records, and missing values.
Predictive Analytics Approach for NY Bank Loan Approval Optimization (300 words)

The modeling phase of the CRISP-DM process shifts NY Bank from hindsight about past loan approval delays to foresight that identifies which new applications are at risk of bottlenecks. Based on the MIT Kaggle loan dataset and the bank’s operational needs, two models are selected: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification. Using both aligns with Agile Analytics principles by balancing interpretability and predictive performance (Collier, 2012).

Logistic Regression is used as the baseline model because it is interpretable, transparent and easy to deploy important characteristics in regulated financial systems. It provides probability estimates that help identify which features such as documentation completeness or creditworthiness, contribute most to delays. This supports clear justification for decisions which is essential for compliance (Provost & Fawcett, 2013). However, Logistic Regression struggles with nonlinear relationships and is sensitive to outliers and missing values which are common in operational banking data (Saporito, 2015).

Random Forest Classification complements the baseline model by offering superior predictive accuracy and resilience to noisy or incomplete data. It captures complex interactions such as those between employment stability and loan purpose that Logistic Regression cannot model. It is especially useful when dealing with inconsistent credit records or human entry errors. The primary limitations of Random Forests are their reduced interpretability and greater computational cost.

To execute this modeling phase effectively, collaboration across several roles is required. I worked closely with a Data Engineer to ensure data quality, a Business Analyst to validate assumptions and a Compliance Officer to ensure regulatory alignment. A Machine Learning Engineer supported model deployment, while a Product Manager ensured the models align with NY Bank’s strategic goals. This cross-functional approach ensured both accuracy and operational relevance.
