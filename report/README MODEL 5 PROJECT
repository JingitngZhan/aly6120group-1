Modeling Phase – Predictive Analytics Approach for NY Bank Loan Approval Optimization
The goal of the modeling phase in the CRISP-DM cycle is to transition from hindsight understanding historical approval delays to foresight that helps NY Bank predict which loan applications are likely to encounter bottlenecks. Based on the structure of the Kaggle MIT loan dataset and the business need to classify applications by risk of delay, this project will employ two predictive modeling approaches: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification. Using both models enables comparison between interpretability and predictive power, ensuring that NY Bank’s senior leadership receives a decision environment that is both transparent and actionable.
Model Selection and Rationale
Logistic Regression is selected as the baseline model because it is interpretable, easy to deploy, and widely used in financial decision systems. It predicts the probability that an application will experience delays based on customer demographics, credit metrics, and documentation patterns. Its coefficients help NY Bank identify which factors such as missing documents, low credit scores, or high debt-to-income ratios are most strongly associated with slow approvals. This aligns with the bank’s need for clear justification in regulated environments.
Random Forest Classification, on the other hand, provides higher predictive accuracy and handles nonlinear relationships that the logistic model cannot capture. It also excels at identifying complex interactions between variables such as employment length, income stability, loan purpose, and documentation completeness. Random Forests are resilient to noisy data and outliers, making them suitable for the bank’s operational data, which may include human entry errors, inconsistent credit records, and missing values.
