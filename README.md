# Business Understanding: AI-Driven Loan Approval Optimization at NY Bank
## Section 1 - Overview of the Business Problem (Samuel)
NY Bank is experiencing operational inefficiencies in its loan approval process, resulting in delayed turnaround times, inconsistent decisions, and low customer satisfaction. These inefficiencies stem from manual documentation checks, disjointed digital systems, and a lack of data-driven insight into workflow bottlenecks. The growing competition in digital banking adds pressure to improve decision speed without compromising risk assessment accuracy. To remain competitive and retain customer trust, NY Bank must transition from reactive decision-making to a proactive, analytics-driven model.
As a transformational leader, I aim to create a culture where data analytics drives decisions and empowers employees to innovate. The goal is to use analytics not only as a technical solution but as a strategic enabler of business improvement, aligning process efficiency with customer-centric outcomes.

## Section 2 - Business Objectives and Leadership Requirements (Jonas) 
Business Objectives
From a business perspective, this analytics initiative will aim to:
i.	Reduce loan approval time by at least 40% through automation and workflow optimization.
ii.	Improve decision consistency and fairness by introducing data-driven risk scoring models.
iii.	Enhance customer satisfaction by delivering faster, transparent, and equitable loan decisions.
These objectives directly support NY Bank’s strategic goals of operational excellence, digital transformation, and long-term client retention

Leadership Requirements
To ensure successful implementation, three leadership requirements are essential:
i.	Cross-functional collaboration: Encouraging open communication between IT, analytics, and loan departments to ensure shared ownership of outcomes.
ii.	Ethical and transparent analytics culture: Building trust in AI-driven decisions by prioritizing explainability, fairness, and bias mitigation.
iii.	Continuous learning and adaptability: Fostering a mind-set of agility where teams view analytics as a dynamic process that evolves with feedback and performance data.
As a leader, I will guide this transformation by applying emotional intelligence, data literacy development, and empowerment strategies to ensure both technical and human alignment.
