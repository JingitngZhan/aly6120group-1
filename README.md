# Backgound
NY Bank is experiencing operational inefficiencies in its loan approval process, resulting in delayed turnaround times, inconsistent decisions, and low customer satisfaction. These inefficiencies stem from manual documentation checks, disjointed digital systems, and a lack of data-driven insight into workflow bottlenecks. The growing competition in digital banking adds pressure to improve decision speed without compromising risk assessment accuracy. To remain competitive and retain customer trust, NY Bank must transition from reactive decision-making to a proactive, analytics-driven model.
As a transformational leader, I aim to create a culture where data analytics drives decisions and empowers employees to innovate. The goal is to use analytics not only as a technical solution but as a strategic enabler of business improvement, aligning process efficiency with customer-centric outcomes.

# About the Campony

NY Bank is a regional commercial bank with a strong focus on retail loans, personal credit, and SME financing. Its loan approval process evaluates multiple risk-related factors such as credit score, applicant income, employment status, loan term, loan amount, and asset value. The bank seeks to modernize and optimize this process through predictive analytics and workflow redesign.

# Data Source

The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle, published under the MIT Open Source License, making it freely available for analysis and model development.
The dataset—loan_approval_dataset.csv—contains essential financial and demographic variables commonly used to predict loan approval outcomes. It is widely utilized for machine learning tasks such as classification modeling, risk scoring, and operational workflow simulations. \\

# Team Collaboration
To ensure responsible use of this external dataset, collaboration would be required with multiple team members. Data engineers validate the structure, schema, and formatting of the CSV file. Business analysts interpret each variable to align it with real-world financial concepts and avoid misapplication. Data stewards help validate whether field definitions match typical industry standards (e.g., credit score ranges, DTI ratios). Even when using open-source data, cross-functional collaboration is essential to ensure contextual accuracy before modeling.
