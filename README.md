# Backgound
NY Bank is experiencing operational inefficiencies in its loan approval process, resulting in delayed turnaround times, inconsistent decisions, and low customer satisfaction. These inefficiencies stem from manual documentation checks, disjointed digital systems, and a lack of data-driven insight into workflow bottlenecks. The growing competition in digital banking adds pressure to improve decision speed without compromising risk assessment accuracy. To remain competitive and retain customer trust, NY Bank must transition from reactive decision-making to a proactive, analytics-driven model.
As a transformational leader, I aim to create a culture where data analytics drives decisions and empowers employees to innovate. The goal is to use analytics not only as a technical solution but as a strategic enabler of business improvement, aligning process efficiency with customer-centric outcomes.
